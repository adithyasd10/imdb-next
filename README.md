# POPCORN FLIX (IMDB Clone)

This project is a **super-modern Movie App inspired by IMDB**, built using the latest technologies and sleek design aesthetics:

- **Next.js 14** (App Router, Server Components, faster builds)
- **Tailwind CSS** for modern, utility-first styling
- **ShadCN UI**, a powerful component library built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- **TMDB APIs** for fetching real movie data and details from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

Popcorn Flix features a **neon-themed interface** with glowing highlights, glassmorphism effects, and Fluent UI-inspired layouts for a visually striking, futuristic experience.
